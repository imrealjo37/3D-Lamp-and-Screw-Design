# 🌟 3D Lamp and Nail Design

## 📖 Description
This project features two 3D models created using **Onshape**:

### 💡 Lamp Design
- **Features:** A cylindrical base, a supporting column, and a hemispherical shade.
- **Tools Used:** 
  - ✏️ **Sketch** for base shapes.
  - 📏 **Extrude** to create the base, column, and other components.
  - 🔄 **Revolve** to form the hemispherical shade.
  - 🪛 **Shell** for hollowing the design.
  - ✨ **Fillet** for smooth edges.
